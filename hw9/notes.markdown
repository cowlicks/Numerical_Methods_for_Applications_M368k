# Programming mini project

The shortest path over the terrain must satisfy:

    y'' = (py' - q)(u + 2vy' + wy'y') / (1 + p**2 + q**2) 

* `p = z_x`
* `q = z_y`
* `u = z_xx`
* `w = z_yy`


## part (a)

## part (b)

 consider the terrain described by:
    
    z = Ax + By + C

which gives:
* ` p = A`
* ` q = B`
* ` u = 0`
* ` w = 0`
