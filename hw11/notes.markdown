# programming mini project hw 11

##(b)
* max is approx `x=0.33333 y=0.23333 z=0.20607`
* `x=0.8 y=0.8 z=0.04198`

##(c)
* with first source function: `x=0.8 y=0.8 z=0.08684` so 107% increase
* with second source function: `x=0.8 y=0.8 z=0.06654` so 59% increase

assuming the pollution is bad, the second factory location will have the *lowest* impact on the school.
